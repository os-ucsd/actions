# Open Source @ UCSD Github Actions ðŸŽ¬

Github Actions written by the Open Source community at UC San Diego!

## About

This repository contains [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) - which are small actions people can use in Github workflows to automate certain tasks. The actions in this repository will be more specific to the open source community at UCSD, but anyone can use them or contribute back!

Every directory in this repo is a separate Github Action - for example, the `/acsweb` directory contains a Github Action for deploying UCSD acsweb sites. 

## Actions

### [`acsweb`](acsweb) - Deploy a Github repo to an ascweb.ucsd.edu site!

If you have a UCSD personal site hosted at `https://acsweb.ucsd.edu/~username`, or your student org has a site at `orgname.ucsd.edu`, you can use this action to sync a Github repository to that site, with just a few lines of code!

See [`acsweb/README.md`](acsweb/README.md) for details and examples.
